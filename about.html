        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <div class="skill-row ">
          <img class="me tImg" src="images/king.jpg" alt="">
          <h3>Some of my skills</h3>
          <p class="left-skill">I possess a solid understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and have experience
             working in both Waterfall and Agile environments. My expertise lies in various testing types, including functional,
              regression, and smoke testing. I have a successful track record in designing and developing test scripts
               using Data-driven, Behavior-driven, and Hybrid Frameworks.

            Proficient in core Java, Selenium WebDriver, Maven, Cucumber, JUnit, TestNG, Jenkins, and other automation tools,
             I am well-equipped to handle test automation projects.
            
            With my comprehensive skill set and hands-on experience, I am capable of ensuring the quality and reliability of
             software systems. I am excited to apply my knowledge to contribute to your organization's success.

        <img class="me bImg" src="images/noal.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Skills++</h3>
        <p class="right-skill">I have leveraged GitHub for version control, ensuring efficient collaboration and streamlined 
            development processes. Additionally, I have extensive experience utilizing Jenkins 
            for continuous integration and deployment, facilitating automated build and release pipelines.

            For effective project management and bug tracking, I have employed JIRA, enabling
             seamless coordination and efficient issue resolution. In back-end testing, SQL has
              been my go-to tool, allowing me to verify data integrity and perform comprehensive testing.
            
            Moreover, I have actively engaged in API testing, utilizing tools such as Postman 
            and the Rest Assured library. This has enabled me to ensure the reliability and
             functionality of APIs, making valuable contributions to project success.
            
            With my proficiency in these technologies and tools, I am confident in my 
            ability to contribute to the success of your projects and deliver high-quality results.

        <h3>I am funny and lovely with my Covid chip</h3>
        <p class="left-skill"> 
            I have a natural inclination towards positivity and consider myself a funny and lovely individual. As a cross-functional team member, I bring a positive attitude and adaptability to changing circumstances. 
            I am detail-oriented and believe in the importance of finding solutions to challenges.

            Steve Jobs once said, 'No matter how smart you are, you need a team of great people.
            ' I wholeheartedly embrace this philosophy and excel as a team player.
             I enjoy collaborating with others and believe in fostering a supportive 
             and inclusive work environment. At the same time, I am also capable of working
              independently and taking ownership of my responsibilities.
            
            With my quick learning abilities and dedication, I am committed 
            to contributing to the success of projects and achieving collective goals. 
            I strongly believe that a positive and collaborative approach is essential for creating exceptional outcomes.
